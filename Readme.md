# App Social
Welcome to "Full-Stack Web Development with React, Spring Boot" In this comprehensive project, i will embark on a journey to master the skills needed to build a full-fledged social media application from scratch. 
This project is designed to help me understand, build, and deploy a modern web application while using a powerful tech stack.

## Topics:

- Front-End Development: We'll dive into React, the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
                       I'll show how to create interactive, dynamic web pages and manage application state with Redux. 
                       I'll also explore responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI (MUI).
